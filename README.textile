Annotation based model factory for Java.

"https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen":https://github.com/mguymon/model-citizen

A Model is mapped by a Blueprint using annotated fields. Blueprints contain 
default values and references to other blueprinted models. The ModelFactory can 
create Models based on registered Blueprints. A Model already created can be
passed into the ModelFactory as a Reference Model, which will be used as the basis
for the new Model.
